# Original problem statement (verbatim)

> We are building improve-javascript-tests n8n pipeline in docker for teams to adapt on their repos.
> Team need to: specify javascript repo, run docker with n8n pipeline against it and get improved
> tests for each file, meaning improved coverage, improved mutation score (with Stryker), improved
> MAC (coverage * mutation score) and to get pr's with improvements for each file where improvements
> happened. Also teams need to see what's happening in n8n right now - is it picking a file to mutate
> or improving coverage or improving mutation score or improving mac or preparing pr. Also there can
> be rules that should be applied to every stage of process - you will implement - e.g. after
> downloading repo, how to act before picking a file (e.g. make separate branch), how to pick file
> (e.g. don't touch ui), on write test (e.g. don't use introspection), on how to check if changes are
> good, how to make pr (e.g. pr style is ...). Teams will use this docker file and n8n workflow
> adapting it to their particular project, so use only n8n native blocks - no shell, no python etc.
>
> Please turn this problem into research, meaning: problem + DoD + reward formula for implementation
> - DoD * implementation_performance. Where DoD is structured list you extracted from problem and
> implementation performance is result of running implementation against 1 synth repo and 10
> real-world repos.

> Implement and improve in ralph loop.

## Amendments during the ralph loop

- 2026-07-24 (iteration 3): added implementation-quality criteria **D11** (no LLM reasoning leakage
  into committed tests) and **D12** (no dead-weight tests; verified cleanup pass).
- 2026-07-24 (iteration 4): per-file improvement criterion — **a file is picked for repeated
  improvement rounds; a round is kept only if at least one of coverage / mutation score / MAC
  improves AND none of them degrades; rounds stop when all three stale or one or more degrades**
  (the degrading round's changes are dropped; previously accepted rounds are kept as commits).
  Rounds are bounded by `MAX_ROUNDS_PER_FILE`. The file then gets one cumulative PR if it netted
  improvement.

- 2026-07-24 (iteration 5): clarified that "javascript repo" includes **UI components**, not just
  plain js/ts logic — the pipeline detects the UI stack (react/vue/svelte/preact +
  @testing-library/*, user-event, jest-dom) and switches to component-testing guidance for
  `.jsx`/`.tsx` files: render + assert on visible behavior via accessible queries, exercise
  props/variants/handlers, no snapshots, no internals.

- 2026-07-25 (iteration 6): **collect human-equivalent timesheets** — for every improved file,
  estimate the developer time the delivered test work would have taken a human (itemized:
  module analysis, test-case writing, mutation analysis, verification/review), and **show it on
  the dashboard per file and cumulatively** — plus **machine time spent, ETA to repo completion,
  and the human-FTE equivalent** (human-equivalent hours ÷ machine hours: how many engineers
  working in parallel the pipeline replaces).
